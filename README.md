# Arrival of Things - React Version

This is a quick translation of the [Arrival of Things](https://github.com/MarkChanner/arrival-of-things/blob/master/README.md) project that I coded yesterday in Vue.js. I suspect that there are some bad practices contained within, such as the plural use of Class Components. The code can be found in the _index.js_ and _index.css_ files.  

As with the Vue.js version, if arrivals to a different station are required, simply enter the station's _NAPTaN code_ into the baseURL value contained in the _http-common.js_ file. The codes for King's Cross St Pancras and Oxford Circus stations are already provided in the file if you would like to try this out.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start
```
